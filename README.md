# tkchat
A chat application written in Python with tkinter

### Goals
- Have no dependencies (besides Python and it's standard lib of course)
- Single threaded concurrency in the client and server
- Stateful client API with GUI "baked in"
- Use JSON "stanzas" in a formal specification
- E2E encryption OR implement OMEMO encryption

### Non-goals
- Be discriminately efficient
- Federation (this may change in the future)

### Installation

Python **3.8** is required for both the client and server to function.

If Python 3.8 is still a pre-release at the time of reading, please download it here:
