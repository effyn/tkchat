# tkchat
A chat application written in Python with tkinter

### Goals
- Have no dependencies (besides Python and its standard library of course)
- Utilize single threaded concurrency for the client and the server
- Offer stateful client API with GUI "baked in"
- Design JSON "stanzas" as a formal specification
- Implement E2E or OMEMO encryption

### Non-goals
- Be strictly efficient
- Federate with other servers (this may change in the future)

### Installation

Python **3.8** is required.
